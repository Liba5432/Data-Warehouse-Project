# 📊 Data Warehouse Project (SQL)

In this project, I built a data warehouse using SQL Server. I collected data from various sources (ETL), structured it clearly (data modeling), and created dashboards for insights, following best practices to ensure the system is efficient, reliable, and easy to use.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture
This project follows the Medallion Architecture approach, organizing data into three structured layers for clarity and efficiency:

- 🥉 **Bronze Layer**: Holds raw, unprocessed data directly imported from CSV files into SQL Server.
- 🥈 **Silver Layer**: Handles data cleaning, standardization, and formatting to make the data analysis-ready.
- 🥇 **Gold Layer**: Contains refined, business-friendly data modeled in a Star Schema, ideal for reporting and insights.

# 📝 Project Overview
Here’s what the project includes, explained simply:

1. **Data Architecture**: Used a layered system (Bronze, Silver, Gold) to keep data organized and easy to manage.
2. **ETL Process**: Collected data, cleaned it, and loaded it into the warehouse using SQL.
3. **Data Modeling**: Set up structured tables (facts and dimensions) to make analysis fast and simple.
4. **Reporting & Insights**: Built clear SQL reports and dashboards to help understand customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends.
